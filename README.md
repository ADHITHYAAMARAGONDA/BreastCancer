Title: Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree

Description:
This project performs predictive analysis on the Breast Cancer dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree models. The objective is to classify tumors as Benign or Malignant based on relevant features.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, performed feature scaling, and encoded categorical variables to improve model accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Implemented KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree for classification.
Evaluated models using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and error rate.
Performance Visualization:

Compared model metrics using bar plots Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Error Rate for better interpretation.
Technologies Used:

R, Tidymodels, Caret, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr
